# What is this?

This is a helper script to setup an apt-cacher-ng and rawdns for your docker containers. Thanks to psftw's [blog](https://psftw.com/2015/01/31/docker_aware_dns_and_transparent_apt_caching.html) and of course tianon.

The only other setup is to add `--dns 172.17.42.1` to your Docker daemon options and add `172.17.42.1` to your systems resolver (`/etc/resolve.conf` if it is not autogenerated).  Be sure to keep something like `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4` in resolve.conf just in case the container or docker fails to start.

# Caveats

`apt-cacher-ng` container may fail to start on boot if the mounted directory does not exist.
